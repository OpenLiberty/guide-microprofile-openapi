== What you'll learn

You will learn how to document and filter RESTful APIs from annotations, POJOs, and static OpenAPI
files by using MicroProfile OpenAPI.

The OpenAPI specification, previously known as the Swagger specification, defines a standard interface
for documenting and exposing RESTful APIs. This specification allows both humans and computers to
understand or process the functionalities of services without requiring direct access to underlying
source code or documentation. The MicroProfile OpenAPI specification provides a set of Java interfaces
and programming models that allow Java developers to natively produce OpenAPI v3 documents from their
JAX-RS applications.

You will document the RESTful APIs of the provided `inventory` service, which serves two endpoints,
`inventory/systems` and `inventory/properties`. These two endpoints function the same way as in the
other MicroProfile guides.

Before you proceed, note that the 1.0 version of the MicroProfile OpenAPI specification does
not define how the `/openapi` endpoint may be partitioned in the event of multiple JAX-RS applications
running on the same server. In other words, you must stick to one JAX-RS application per server instance
as the behaviour for handling multiple applications is currently undefined.

Next, point your browser to the {openapi-url}[{openapi-url}^] URL and you'll see the RESTful APIs of the `inventory`
service. You can also point to the {openapi-url}/ui[{openapi-url}/ui^] URL for a more interactive view of the deployed APIs.
This UI is built from the https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/[Open Source Swagger UI^] and renders the generated `/openapi` document into a very user friendly page.

// Generating APIs
// =================================================================================================

== Generating the OpenAPI document for the inventory service

You can generate an OpenAPI document in various ways. First, because
all JAX-RS annotations are processed by default, you can augment your existing JAX-RS annotations with
OpenAPI annotations to enrich your APIs with a minimal amount of work. Second, you can use a set of predefined
models to manually create all elements of the OpenAPI tree. Finally, you can filter various elements of the
OpenAPI tree, changing them to your liking or removing them entirely.

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/devmode-start.adoc[]

Because the JAX-RS framework handles basic API generation for JAX-RS annotations, a skeleton OpenAPI
tree will be generated from the `inventory` service. You can use this tree as a starting point and
augment it with annotations and code to produce a complete OpenAPI document.

Now, point to the {openapi-url}[{openapi-url}^] URL to see the generated OpenAPI tree. You can also point to the
{openapi-url}/ui[{openapi-url}/ui^] URL for a more interactive view of the APIs.


=== Augmenting the existing JAX-RS annotations with OpenAPI annotations

Because all JAX-RS annotations are processed by default, you can augment the existing code with OpenAPI
annotations without needing to rewrite portions of the OpenAPI document that are already covered by
the JAX-RS framework.

[role='code_command hotspot file=0', subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `InventoryResource` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java`
----

[role="edit_command_text"]
Add OpenAPI [hotspot=APIResponses file=0]`@APIResponses`, [hotspot=Operation file=0]`@Operation` and [hotspot=Parameter file=0]`@Parameter` annotations to the two JAX-RS methods, [hotspot=host-property hotspot=Parameter file=0]`getPropertiesForHost()` and [hotspot=listContents file=0]`listContents()`.

Clearly, there are many more OpenAPI annotations now, so letâ€™s break them down:

[cols="35, 200", options="header"]
|===
| *Annotation*    | *Description*
| [hotspot=APIResponses file=0]`@APIResponses` | A container for multiple responses from an API operation. This annotation is
optional, but it can be helpful to organize a method with multiple responses.
| [hotspot=APIResponse file=0]`@APIResponse`  | Describes a single response from an API operation.
| [hotspot=Content file=0]`@Content`      | Provides a schema and examples for a particular media type.
| [hotspot=Schema file=0]`@Schema`       | Defines the input and output data types.
| [hotspot=Operation file=0]`@Operation`    | Describes a single API operation on a path.
| [hotspot=Parameter file=0]`@Parameter`    | Describes a single operation parameter.
|===

Since the Open Liberty server was started in development mode at the beginning of the guide, your changes were automatically picked up.
Refresh the {openapi-url}[{openapi-url}^]
URL to see the updated OpenAPI tree. The two endpoints at which your JAX-RS methods are
served are now more meaningful:

[source, YAML, role="no_copy"]
----
/inventory/systems/{hostname}:
  get:
    summary: Get JVM system properties for particular host
    description: Retrieves and returns the JVM system properties from the system
      service running on the particular host.
    operationId: getPropertiesForHost
    parameters:
    - name: hostname
      in: path
      description: The host for whom to retrieve the JVM system properties for.
      required: true
      schema:
        type: string
      example: foo
    responses:

        content:
          text/plain: {}
      200:
        description: JVM system properties of a particular host.
        content:

/inventory/systems:
  get:

            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/InventoryList'
----


OpenAPI annotations can also be added to POJOs to describe what they represent. Currently, your OpenAPI
document doesn't have a very meaningful description of the [hotspot=InventoryListClass file=1]`InventoryList` POJO and hence it's very
difficult to tell exactly what that POJO is used for. To describe the [hotspot=InventoryListClass file=1]`InventoryList` POJO in more detail, augment the
[hotspot file=1]`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/model/InventoryList.java` file with some OpenAPI annotations.

[role='code_command hotspot file=1', subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `InventoryList` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/model/InventoryList.java`
----

[role='edit_command_text']
Add OpenAPI [hotspot=InventoryList hotspot=Systems file=1]`@Schema` annotations to the [hotspot=InventoryList file=1]`InventoryList` class and the [hotspot=Systems file=1]`systems` variable.

InventoryList.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/model/InventoryList.java[]
----

Likewise, annotate the [hotspot file=2]`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/model/SystemData.java` POJO,
which is referenced in the [hotspot file=1]`InventoryList` class.

[role='code_command hotspot file=2', subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `SystemData` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/model/SystemData.java`
----

[role='edit_command_text']
Add OpenAPI [hotspot=SystemData hotspot=Hostname hotspot=Properties file=2]`@Schema` annotations to the [hotspot=SystemData file=2]`SystemData` class, the [hotspot=Hostname file=2]`hostname` variable and the [hotspot=Properties file=2]`properties` variable.

=== Filtering the OpenAPI tree elements

Filtering of certain elements and fields of the generated OpenAPI document can be done by using the
`OASFilter` interface.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `InventoryOASFilter` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/filter/InventoryOASFilter.java`
----
InventoryOASFilter.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/filter/InventoryOASFilter.java[]
----

The [hotspot=filterAPIResponse file=0]`filterAPIResponse()` method allows filtering of `APIResponse` elements. When you
override this method, it will be called once for every `APIResponse` element in the OpenAPI tree.
In this case, you are matching the `404` response that is returned by the `/inventory/systems/{hostname}`
endpoint and setting the previously missing description. To remove an `APIResponse` element
or another filterable element, simply return `null`.

The [hotspot=filterOpenAPI file=0]`filterOpenAPI()` method allows filtering of the singleton [hotspot=OpenAPI file=0]`OpenAPI` element. Unlike other filter
methods, when you override [hotspot=filterOpenAPI file=0]`filterOpenAPI()`, it is called only once as the last method
for a particular filter. Hence, make sure that it doesn't override any other filter operations that are
called before it. Your current OpenAPI document doesn't provide much information on the application
itself or on what server and port it runs on. This information is usually provided in the `info`
and `servers` elements, which are currently missing. Use the `OASFactory` class to manually set these
and other elements of the OpenAPI tree from the `org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.models`
package. The [hotspot=OpenAPI file=0]`OpenAPI` element is the only element that cannot be removed since that would mean
removing the whole OpenAPI tree.

Each filtering method is called once for each corresponding element in the model tree. You can think
of each method as a callback for various key OpenAPI elements.

Before you can use the filter class that you created, you need to create the [hotspot file=1]`microprofile-config.properties` file.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the configuration file.#
`src/main/webapp/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`
----
microprofile-config.properties
[source, text, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=Scan']
----
include::finish/src/main/webapp/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

This configuration file is picked up automatically by MicroProfile Config and registers your filter
by passing in the fully qualified name of the filter class into the [hotspot=Config file=1]`mp.openapi.filter` property.

Refresh the {openapi-url}[{openapi-url}^] URL to see the updated OpenAPI tree:

// =================================================================================================
// Pre-generated APIs
// =================================================================================================

== Using pregenerated OpenAPI documents

As an alternative to generating the OpenAPI model tree from code, you can provide a valid pregenerated
OpenAPI document to describe your APIs. This document must be named `openapi` with a `yml`, `yaml`, or `json`
extension and be placed under the `META-INF` directory. Depending on the scenario, the document
might be fully or partially complete. If the document is fully complete, then you can disable
annotation scanning entirely by setting the `mp.openapi.scan.disable` MicroProfile Config property to `true`.
If the document is partially complete, then you can augment it with code.

To use the pre-generated OpenAPI document, create the OpenAPI document YAML file.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the OpenAPI document file.#
`src/main/webapp/META-INF/openapi.yaml`
----


openapi.yaml
[source, text, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/webapp/META-INF/openapi.yaml[]
----

This document is the same as your current OpenAPI document with extra APIs for the `/inventory/properties` endpoint. 
Since this document is complete, you can also add the [hotspot=Scan file=1]`mp.openapi.scan.disable` property
and set it to `true` in the [hotspot file=1]`src/main/webapp/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` file.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the configuration file.#
`src/main/webapp/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`
----

[role="edit_command_text"]
Add and set the [hotspot=Scan file=1]`mp.openapi.scan.disable` property to `true`.

microprofile-config.properties
[source, text, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/webapp/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

Refresh the {openapi-url}[{openapi-url}^] URL to see the updated OpenAPI tree:

[source, yml, role="no_copy"]
----
/inventory/properties:
  get:
    operationId: getProperties
    responses:
      200:
        description: JVM system properties of the host running this service.
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              additionalProperties:
                type: string
----


// =================================================================================================
// Testing the services
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the service

No automated tests are provided to verify the correctness of the generated OpenAPI document. Manually
verify the document by visiting the {openapi-url}[{openapi-url}^] or the {openapi-url}/ui[{openapi-url}/ui^] URL.

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functionality of the `inventory` service. If a test
failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code. These tests will run automatically
as a part of the integration test suite.

[role='command']

You have just documented and filtered the APIs of the `inventory` service from both the code and a static
file by using MicroProfile OpenAPI in Open Liberty.

Feel free to try one of the related MicroProfile guides. They demonstrate additional technologies that you
can learn and expand on top of what you built here.
